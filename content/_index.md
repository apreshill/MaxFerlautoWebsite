description: I am a PhD student at the University of Maryland [Entomology department](https://entomology.umd.edu/) in the [Burghardt Lab](https://www.karinburghardt.com/). I am interested in urban ecology, novel ecosystems, and plant-insect interactions. Specifically, I study how suburban leaf litter removal affects insect communities and nutrient cycling. Litter removal is a surprisingly understudied topic that may have negative consequences to biodiversity and ecosystem processes.
